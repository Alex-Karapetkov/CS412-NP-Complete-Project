# ðŸ“Š CS 412 Final Project Presentation â€“ Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This folder contains the presentation slides for my final project in **CS 412: Applied Algorithms** at James Madison University.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Topic

The project focused on solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using both an approximation algorithm (based on Prim's MST and preorder traversal) and an exact solution (using the 2-Opt heuristic). The presentation explains:

- The significance and complexity of TSP
- Decision vs. optimization formulations
- Polynomial-time certifier and NP-completeness
- Reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
- Pseudocode and runtime analysis of both algorithms
- Practical applications in routing, logistics, and hardware design


For more on the implementation, see the source code in the `code_solution/` folder.
